**What book did you choose? What is it about?**  

I have chosen the book "The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything" by Matthew Ball. This book delves into the concept of the metaverse, exploring how virtual worlds, augmented reality, and interconnected digital spaces are poised to transform our lives, economies, and societies. It examines the potential impact of the metaverse on various aspects of human existence, from entertainment and work to education and social interactions.  

**What aspect of the book will you include in your cover?**  

For the interactive book cover, I want to encapsulate the essence of the metaverse and the transformative journey it offers to readers. I will create a visually engaging and immersive digital artwork that symbolizes the convergence of real and virtual worlds. The cover will be a gateway to the metaverse, inviting readers to explore its limitless possibilities.  

**Is it interactive?  time-based?  both?**  

This design incorporates both interactive and time-based elements to engage the viewer in a dynamic visual experience.

Enhancing Interactivity with Mouse Events: In this design, one end of the line remains stationary, while the other end dynamically follows the mouse position, adding an interactive element to the composition.

Introducing Time-Based Effects: Simultaneously, the square shapes undergo a gradual fade-in and fade-out animation, creating a time-based visual enhancement.  

**What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?**  

Symbolism and Visual Metaphors: In the visual design of the cover, I intend to experiment with the use of symbolism and visual metaphors to convey complex ideas from the book. The challenge lies in effectively translating these abstract ideas, such as the metaverse, virtual reality, interconnected networks, and digital transformation, into visually compelling elements that resonate with readers.  

**Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we’ve done?**  

Yes, there are indeed aspects of my project that resonate with the themes explored in “Program or Be Programmed” by Douglas Rushkoff. In “Program or Be Programmed”, Rushkoff posits that individuals should strive to be active, knowledgeable participants in the digital realm rather than passive consumers. Similarly, my project aims to encourage an engaged and informed interaction with technology. The metaverse, as explored in my interactive book cover design, represents a transformative digital frontier, akin to the digital landscape Rushkoff discusses.  

Through the visual design of the interactive book cover, I intend to foster curiosity and engagement, much like Rushkoff's call for individuals to actively shape their digital experiences. By offering an immersive and dynamic experience, my project encourages readers to contemplate the evolving nature of the metaverse and its potential consequences for our lives.
